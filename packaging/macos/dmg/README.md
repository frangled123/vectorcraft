# Nodus installer window

`background.svg` is the editable 660 × 400 pt source. It uses the shared ribbon logo, the app accent and the repository’s OFL Inter fonts. `background.tiff` contains 1× and 2× images. The Finder layout positions `Nodus.app` at (326, 205) and Applications at (574, 205), with a 128 pt icon size.

The volume name must be `Nodus` because the background alias uses that name. Regenerate with `python3 packaging/macos/dmg/generate.py` after installing free build dependencies `pillow>=12`, `ds_store==1.3.3` and `mac_alias==2.2.3`, with resvg on PATH. The generator uses only repository fonts and fixed alias metadata.
